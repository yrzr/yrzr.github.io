Happy Easter!

Finally, got some time to write all this.

## Site Down

Some might have noticed that everything under my domain 'yrzr.tk' is no longer reachable, including this blog, my FTP site for OPNsense pkg, and my self-hosted gitlab site.

Long story short, as I have replied to your question from emails and on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/yrzr/opnsense-tools/issues/15), My domain name provider, Freenom, had my domain status changed to "pending" and did not respond to my emails, together went down the DNS service.

Considering Meta is suing Freenom, I don't expect they will have my domain recovered. Therefore, I guess I just have to give it up. After all, you cannot blame too much on a free thing. And luckily, what I was using on the domain was nothing important.

## Some Thoughts

There were some thoughts about getting another domain, maybe buying one for a decade. However, things have changed a lot since I started writing this blog.

I have graduated and become a wage earner, which means more scheduled work and less free time (although I have to admit it was a relief from psychological stress). I have also adopted a cute kitty with my wife and am about to have another family member, so more family time to take, and responsibility to hold. Also, people from the Github issue page are waiting for help, but I rarely have the time and spirit.

## Replacements

A simple web service that can free me from all these staffs about domains, DNS, SSL certificates, DDoS defense, etc., would be great, especially when it is free.

Therefore, I moved this blog to github.io. `yrzr.tk` becomes the past, and here comes `yrzr.github.io`.

The only downside of github.io is that it can hardly be used as a file server. However, using raw IP without an SSL certificate is also acceptable for OPNsense packages. As for other things, such as gitlab, I just move them to the local area network in my home.

## Outlooks

As a new start, I hope to share more interesting things that might help people, as well as some valuable moments about my life, through this blog.

And here comes Luna, on her first week home.
